# Tutorials

Stand-alone scripts illustrating how to use the `CtrlVQE` package for common tasks.
Use them as a model for writing your own code.

To run a tutorial, you may run its script directly (eg. `> julia optimization.jl`),
    or through the `Tutorials` package
    (find installation instructions in the root README file).

```
julia> import Tutorials
julia> Tutorials.run(:optimization)    # Runs the script "optimization.jl"
```
